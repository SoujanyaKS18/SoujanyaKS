# Dear Developer

If you have come this far, it means that you have gone further in our selection process. Now it's time for us to do a little technical evaluation with you.

Through this assessment, we will be evaluating your ability to manipulate the DOM. The exercises should be delivered through a GitHub repository and all the code that you'll write should be runnable into the browser's console.

The assessment consists of three exercises and for each of them, we will provide a URL that will serve as the basis for you to perform code manipulations.

* [Exercise 1](https://github.com/tntdevs/interview-survey/wiki/Exercise-1)
* [Exercise 2](https://github.com/tntdevs/interview-survey/wiki/Exercise-2)
* [Exercise 3](https://github.com/tntdevs/interview-survey/wiki/Exercise-3)
