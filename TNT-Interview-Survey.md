# Dear Developer

If you have come this far, it means that you have gone further in our selection process. Now it's time for us to do a little technical evaluation with you.

Through this assessment, we will be evaluating your ability to manipulate the DOM. The exercises should be delivered through a GitHub repository and all the code that you'll write should be runnable into the browser's console.

The assessment consists of three exercises and for each of them, we will provide a URL that will serve as the basis for you to perform code manipulations.

## Exercise 1

[Exercise URL](https://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04)

1. Transform the icons' row into 2 rows and make it occupy only the left half of the page container;

2. Move the search box to the remaining right half of the container;

    _You'll notice that this page works with 4 different viewports (mobile, tablet, medium desktop and large desktop).  
    The changes that we asked above are for the desktop ones._

3. For mobile and tablet viewports, the icons are already showing in the right way (1 row for each icon on mobile and 2 icons per row on the tablet). So, your task will be to move the search box above the icons on those two viewports.
