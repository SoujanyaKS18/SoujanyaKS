1. On the tiles section, make the **Alienware Laptops** the first tile just after **Shop All** tile;

2. Since you changed the tiles' order, we need to change the sections' order. So, in the sections below the tiles, make sure to change the **Alienware Laptops** to the first section position instead of **Inspiron Laptops**;

3. Create a dynamic list of links based on the left ANAV filters categories (Screen Size, Processor, Memory...) where each link should take the user to a page with all the clicked category filters activated. This list should be appended over the first section.
